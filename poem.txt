Swift is the hare, cunning's the fox
This young calf shall grow to be a fox
He'll make his living amongst the briars and thorns
And die like his dad, with a great set of horns

Big fleas have little fleas on their backs to bite them
and those little fleas have lesser fleas, and so ad infinitum.
And the great fleas, themselves in  turn have greater fleas to go on.
And those great fleas have greater fleas, and greater fleas and so on.
